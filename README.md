# Feed Reader Testing

Implementation of Jasmine test suited for a simple feed reader web app provided for the project.
This is the fourth project submission on the Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree.

Try it live here: [https://andreasrafn.github.io/FeedReaderTesting/](https://andreasrafn.github.io/FeedReaderTesting/)

The live version loads the app, runs the Jasmine test suites, and reports the results in the bottom of the page.
Note that a Jasmine stand-alone installation is provided by Udacity and referenced in the index.html file, hence no installation of jasmine is required to run the tests.
